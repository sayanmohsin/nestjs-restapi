## Description

This is a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs using NestJS framework. The boilerplate follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture to organize the project into distinct layers, separating concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability. It uses Prisma as the database ORM for efficient data access, JWT tokens for authentication, and AdminJS for the admin interface.

## Features

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) framework for building scalable and maintainable APIs.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) as the database ORM for efficient data access.
- JWT authentication for securing API endpoints.
- [AdminJS](https://adminjs.com) for a customizable admin interface to manage resources.
- DDD architecture for better code organization and separation of concerns.
- Pre-configured error handling, logging, and environment configuration.
- Scalable folder structure with modules, services, controllers, and DTOs.
- RESTful API conventions and validation with built-in decorators.
- Unit testing setup with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and code coverage reports.
- Docker configuration for easy deployment and containerization.

- npm (>= 6.0.0)
